# Week 06 - Deep Learning - Day 2 - Exercise 2

This exercise focuses on a key aspect of neural network: the stopping criterion.
The later is used to prevent neural networks from overfitting.

The exercise will also introduce different aspects of neural networks that might be of interest during projects.
