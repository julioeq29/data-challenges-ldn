# Week 06 - Deep Learning - Day 2 - Exercise 1

The exercise uses the Tensorflow playground as a tool to visually check how different hyperparameters of neural networks impact the convergence of the algorithm.

This baseline is also used to translate what the students do on the Playground to its writing with the Keras library
