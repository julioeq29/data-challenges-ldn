# Week 06 - Deep Learning - Day 1 - Exercise 1

The first exercise is an introduction to Deep Learning. Thanks to the Tensorflow playground, a site that emulates a neural network, the student will get a hint and intuitions about Deep Learning. It is also intended to give them a mental/visual representation of neural network that will ease their comprehension for the rest of the week.
