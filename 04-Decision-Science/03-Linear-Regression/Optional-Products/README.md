## Products

This challange takes a similar approach from the `sellers` one, but applies it to `products`, grouped by `product_category`

There might be some `product_category` that significantly underperforms others, and that could be removed from the marketplace.

In the following notebook `product.ipynb` :
- We will give you a clean training_set with every information possible about products (one row per unique product_id)
- You will analyze which product category repetitively underperform others
