# Logistic Regression

The exercice consists of training and scoring a Logistic Regression Classifier before using it to make predictions on new data.

The dataset:
- `rating` : the rating of the university in a range [0,5]
- `CGPA` : the Cumulative Grade Points Average of the student
- `admitted` : whether or not a student is admitted to the university

The task is to predict if a student will be admitted to a university considering his CGPA and the rating of the university he is applying to.

To start the exercise, open `Logistic-Regression.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.
